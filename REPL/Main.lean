# A REPL for Lean.

Communicates via JSON on stdin and stdout. Commands should be separated by blank lines.

Commands may be of the form
```
{ "cmd" : "import Mathlib.Data.List.Basic\ndef f := 2" }
```
or
```
{ "cmd" : "example : f = 2 := rfl", "env" : 3 }
```

The `env` field, if present,
must contain a number received in the `env` field of a previous response,
and causes the command to be run in the existing environment.

If there is no `env` field, a new environment is created.

You can only use `import` commands when you do not specify the `env` field.

You can backtrack simply by using earlier values for `env`.

The results are of the form
```
{"sorries":
 [{"pos": {"line": 1, "column": 18},
   "endPos": {"line": 1, "column": 23},
   "goal": "\n⊢ Nat"}],
 "messages":
 [{"severity": "error",
   "pos": {"line": 1, "column": 23},
   "endPos": {"line": 1, "column": 26},
   "data":
   "type mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  f = f : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  f = 2 : Prop"}],
 "env": 6}
 ```
 showing any messages generated, or sorries with their goal states.
 Information is generated for tactic mode sorries, but not for term mode sorries.
