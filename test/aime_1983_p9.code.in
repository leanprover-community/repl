  To find the minimum value of $
                                rac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$, we need to show that it is at least 12. We start by noting that the expression can be rewritten using the division property of inequalities. We then use the fact that \$sin x$ and $x$ are positive in the given range to establish the necessary inequalities. Finally, we apply these results to conclude that the minimum value is indeed 12.
